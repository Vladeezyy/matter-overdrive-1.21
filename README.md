# Matter Overdrive for Minecraft 1.21.8 (NeoForge and Fabric)

![Matter Overdrive](docs/modrinth/banner.png)

An unofficial port of [Matter Overdrive](https://github.com/simeonradivoev/MatterOverdrive) by Simeon Radivoev
from Minecraft 1.7.10 to **Minecraft 1.21.8** on **NeoForge 21.8** and **Fabric** (Fabric API; Team Reborn Energy for
FE is included in the jar).

This is the `1.21.8` branch. It builds both loaders from one `common` module (all game code, compiled on
vanilla) plus thin `neoforge/` and `fabric/` modules. Every supported Minecraft version has its own branch with the same game code: `main`
(1.21.10), `1.21.8`, `1.21.5`, `1.21.4`, `1.21.3` and `1.21.1`. The APIs that differ are bridged in
`matteroverdrive.compat`, and `tools/backport.py` converts the generated resources for the branch's version.

The port is a rewrite against modern APIs that keeps the original's behaviour, numbers, textures, sounds and
translations (English and Russian; the port adds Ukrainian, German, Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil), not by native
speakers). The 1.7.10 source (0.4.2) is the specification.

# Matter Overdrive for Minecraft 1.21.10 (NeoForge)

![Matter Overdrive](docs/modrinth/banner.png)

An unofficial port of [Matter Overdrive](https://github.com/simeonradivoev/MatterOverdrive) by Simeon Radivoev
from Minecraft 1.7.10 to **Minecraft 1.21.10** on **NeoForge 21.10**.

The port is a rewrite against modern APIs that keeps the original's behaviour, numbers, textures, sounds and
translations (English and Russian). The 1.7.10 source (0.4.2) is the specification.

## Building
Requires JDK 21.
```bash
./gradlew build              # jar in build/libs/
./gradlew runClient          # dev client
./gradlew runGameTestServer  # headless in-game tests
./gradlew runScene           # scripted scene: screenshots of the machines and features to run/screenshots/
```
`runScene` needs a world named `mo_scene` in `run/saves/` (any copy of a dev world).
Resources for simple content are generated from the original 1.7.10 assets by `tools/gen_resources.py`
(see MODLOG.md for the command).
